This is our attempt with my brother to create a twin USB midi-controller that can be used to cue live performance software using two separate computers. The usual solution is not isolating the two port galvanically, which is typical a problem in audio production situations. The cause of the usual noise is the ground loop created by connecting the workstations. This solution will galvanically isolate the two USB ports, while it still can be powered from either of them.

This project is a proof-of-concept circuit board, 3d printed case and software. If it works we might take a further step to create an actual product that can be purchased.
